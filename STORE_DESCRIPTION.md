### The Problem You're Solving

Have you ever lost track of related ChatGPT conversations? Struggled to remember which chat branch led to that breakthrough solution? Wished you could visualize how your conversations connect? Arbor solves all of this by organizing your ChatGPT conversations into beautiful, interactive trees.

### What Arbor Does

**🌳 Organize & Visualize Your Conversations**
Create hierarchical trees of your ChatGPT conversations. See how different chats relate to each other with an intuitive tree view and interactive graph visualization. Never lose track of your conversation threads again.

**🔗 Branch Conversations Intelligently**
Want to explore a different direction from an existing conversation? Arbor lets you create branches from any ChatGPT chat, maintaining the context and relationship between parent and child conversations. Perfect for exploring alternative solutions, variations, or related topics.

**🤖 AI-Powered Context Generation**
When creating branches, Arbor uses Google Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite to intelligently summarize your previous conversation, automatically generating context that you can paste into your new branch. No more manual copying or losing important context.

**📊 Visual Graph Navigation**
See your entire conversation hierarchy at a glance with Arbor's interactive graph view. Click any node to instantly navigate to that conversation. Understand relationships, dependencies, and the flow of your ideas.

Arbor automatically detects when you're in a ChatGPT conversation and offers to track it. No manual setup required – just click "Track this chat" and it's added to your tree.
